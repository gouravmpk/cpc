        Cockroach is a very common problem in every household and also in every hook and corner. For years cockroaches have played havoc in peoples lives. It is important to try and get rid of them before they become bigger problems. They move from one place to other very easily. Cockroaches eat almost any organic matter. They seek out food scraps, unsealed food containers, sugar and grease deposits, pet food, rancid meat glue and even book bindings etc. Cockroaches are nocturnal feeders, they rest during daylight hours in dark warm secure harborages in your home, such as, in wall cavities, the sub-floor, roof void, cracks and crevices in the kitchen and bathroom, electrical appliances and foodstuffs. They will emerge from these harborages in the still of the night. Cockroaches have an array of acute sensory and survival instincts. If left unchecked a cockroach infestation can rapidly expand it's numbers in a few weeks or months to become major risk to health and safety.
