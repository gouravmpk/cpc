        Honey Bees are being "domesticated" by humans, largely due to their habit of building its nests within cavities (e.g. amongst rocks or within hollows in trees), the have been cultivated by humans for at least 5000 years.

        <br/>
       <p1>Worker honey bees make hives to store honey and feed themselves throughout winter when they cannot go outdoors to forage for food. Honey bee hives are made of six-sided tubes, which are the shapes for optimal honey production because they require less wax and can hold more honey. Some hives develop broods which become dark in color over time because of cocoon tracks and travel stains. Other honey bee hives remain light in color. The Worker bees only live for approximately six weeks, they spend their lives performing tasks that benefit the survival of their colony. The species is characterized by colonies numbering 10s of thousands that form multiple combs per colony and build their colonies within cavities. The colonies can survive in a very wide range of climates (most climates occupied by humans) and can use a range of food sources. Colonies can live very wide through winters in cool temperate zones by laying down considerable stores of honey gathered through the summer months.</p1>

        <strong>FOR CONTROL OF BEE HIVES</strong>
        <br/>
        <p>Chemical is sprayed at the Bee Hive using full pressure with the help of skilled technicians using a big pressure pump. The said procedure instantly kills all the bees and thereafter the bee hive is removed. After the said treatment the bees do not build the hives at that place again.</p>
