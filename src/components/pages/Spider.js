            <strong>BEHAVIOR, DIET and HABITS OF SPIDERS</strong>
        <p>
        Some spiders like moisture and are found in Basements, crawl spaces and other damp parts of buildings. Others like dry, warm areas such as subfloor air vents, upper corners of rooms and attics. They hide in dark areas. They feed on insects, other spiders and any other prey they are able to subdue.
        </p>
        <br/>
       <p1>Spiders do not have chewing mouthparts and commonly utilize digestive enzymes in their saliva to break prey down before consuming it. Additionally, the gut of a spider is too narrow to allow for consumption of large food particles. Almost all spider species are predators, although one plant-feeding species has been documented.</p1>
        <br/>
        <strong>HOW DO THEY GET IN THE HOME?</strong>
        <br/>
        <p1>Spiders commonly enter homes in two primary ways: entering through open, poorly screened windows and doors and through cracks and gaps around door and window frames. Most of the time, spiders come inside the home looking for prey. The other common method of entry is numerous other things that are brought inside a home or business. Contact your pest management professional if you find spiders in your home. The Pest management profession will conduct an inspection and creates a comprehensive control plan that is based on the inspection findings.</p1>
