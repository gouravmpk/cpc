            <strong>PRE-CONSTRUCTIONAL ANTI TERMITE TREATMENT</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong>SOIL TREATMENT BACK FILL</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
        <p>
        Soil is treated in contact with masonry walls starting from the base of the trenches till the ground level. Treating the soil beneath the building and around the foundations with a soil insecticide is a preventive measure. The purpose of treatment is to create a chemical barrier between the ground from where termites come. Holes are made on both sides of the wall and insecticide emulsion is injected under the pressure of vertical surface area.
       </p>
       <br/>
       <strong>MASONRY FOUNDATION TREATMENT</strong>
       <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>The bottom surface and the sides of the excavations made from the masonry foundations and basements shall be treated with the chemical. Holes are made at the base of masonry trenches at every 150 mm centre to centre and 50 to 75mm deep. Chemical is thereafter sprayed under pressure in these holes so as to eradicate the termites at the base.</p1>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>JUNCTION OF WALL AND FLOOR TREATMENT</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>To establish continuity of vertical chemical barrier on inner wall surface from ground level upto the level of the filled earth surface special, care needs to be taken. To achieve this 30mm x 30mm channel is made and rod holes are made in the channel upto the ground level of 150 mm apart and the iron rod is moved backward and forward to break the earth and the chemical emulsion is poured. The soil is thereafter tamped back into place.</p1>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>TOP SURFACE OF PLINTH FILLING TREATMENT</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>Plinth walls shall be treated with chemical emulsion before the sand bed or sub-grade is laid. Holes are made at 150 mm apart and 50 to 75 mm deep and insecticide emulsion is injected in the entire carpet area within the plinth wall to prevent entry of termites through slab joints of the flooring.</p1>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>TREATMENT BEFORE PLINTH PROTECTION</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>Holes are made 50-75 mm deep and 150 mm apart in the soil above which apron is be laid and thereafter insecticide emulsion is injected under pressure. The said procedure shall prevent horizontal cross over of the termites into the building.</p1>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>TREATMENT OF SOIL SURROUNDING PIPES, WASTES AND CONDUITS</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>When pipes. wastes and combits enter the soil inside the area of the foundation, the soil surrounding the point is loosened around each pipe, wastes or conduit for a distance of 150 mm and depth of 75 mm is commenced before treatment. After entering into the soil from outside of the foundation similar treatment is given at a distance of over 300 mm unless they stand clear to the walls of the building by about 75 mm.</p1>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>NETWORKS OF TUNNELS</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>Termites are the most destructive and frequently encountered type infesting buildings and are closely associated with the soil habitat where they excavate a network of tunnels through the soil horizons.Termites get triggered by warm temperature and higher level of humidity. These usually emerge during spring season in large numbers and swarm to disperse and start new colonies. They then drop to the ground, shed their wings, pair off with a mate and attempt to begin new colonies in the soil. The queen termite is essentially an egg laying machine," which can lay up to 30.000 eggs per day.</p1>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>DAMAGES CAUSED DUE TO TERMITES</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/>
       <p1>Most common materials attacked by termites include leather goods, wall paper, books. thatch roofs in houses, carpets, buried electrical and telephone cables, wooden poles and bridges. bamboo pegs of army tents, railway coathes, and historical monuments, etc.</p1>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <strong>ADVANTAGES OF PRE-CONSTRUCTIONAL ANTI TERMITE TREATMENT</strong>
        <br/>
        
       <p1>Termite Treatment creates a persistent toxic barrier.</p1>
       <br/>
       <br/>

       <strong>POST-CONSTRUCTIONAL ANTI TERMITE TREATMENT</strong>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <p1>This treatment is a preventive measure for the existing structure / building. Procedure includes like side external walls of the inner walls of the premises which are drilled by punching holes of 8 mm diameter at 45 degree angle about 5 to 8 cm deep at 30 cm center to center close to wall and a chemical based emulsion is injected, which is diluted and inserted by means of a pressure pump and the said holes are plugged in with cement mortar by 1:2 proportion (one cement and two coarse sand] to match the existing floor and for the outer external walls. A chemical barrier and restricts termite entry and protects the treated structure. The same is as per I.S. 6313 (Part III) of 191.</p1>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p>Further complete spraying treatment is given to all wood works such as furniture, fixtures, doors. windows. window frames, showcases. wardrobes, etc.. of the premises to eradicate termites and other harmful pests for being and property.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>STAGES OF TREATMENT</strong>
        <br/>
        <p>The structure to be treated should be isolated from any other structure. The stages of the treatment are mentioned below.</p>
        <br/>
        
       <strong>FIRST</strong>
       <br/>
       <p1>Treatment of soil under floor</p1>
        <br/>
        <p>On the ground floor, if the cracks are noticed because of construction joints or shrinkage, the soil below floor needs to be treated. Holes of 6mm dia 30cm apart will be drilled along the cracks only and water based chemical emulsion will be injected.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>SECOND</strong>
       <br/>
       <p1>Treatment along the external perimeter of the building</p1>
        <br/>
        <p>Trenching or drill in holes along the external walls of the building (similar to stage of mentioned above will be carried out to create a continuous chemical barrier around the entire area.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>THIRD</strong>
       <br/>
       <p1>Treatment to wall and floor junction</p1>
        <br/>
        <p>Holes of 6mm dia 30cm apart will be drilled at 45 degree along the inner junction of wall and floor in the ground floor premises. Water based chemical emulsion will be injected under pressure into these holes, to create a barrier against termites. If the building is on stilts, holes shall be drilled along the column sides at ground level.</p>
        <br/>

        <strong>FOURTH</strong>
       <br/>
       <p1>Treatment to wooden fixtures</p1>
        <br/>
        <p>Holes of 6mm diameter will be drilled at the base of wooden members such as window frames, door frames inset in the flooring and water based chemical emulsion will be injected. This treatment will done on all floor (except basement/terrace). An oil-based chemical will be sprayed on all the woodwork infested by termites within the premises.</p>
