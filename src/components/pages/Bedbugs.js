        Bedbugs are one of the great travelers of the world and are readily transported via luggage, clothing, bedding and furniture. Cracks and crevices of bed frames should be examined, especially if the frame is wood. Bed bugs have an affinity for wood and fabric.
        </p>
        <br/>
       <p1>Bedbugs may enter your home undetected through luggage, clothing, used beds and couches, and other items. Their flattened bodies make it possible for them to fit into tiny spaces, about the width of a credit card. Bedbugs do not have nests like ants or bees, but tend to live in groups in hiding places. Their initial hiding places are typically in mattresses, box springs, bed frames, and headboards where they have easy access to people to bite in the night.</p1>
        <br/>
        <p>Over time they get scattered through the bedroom, moving into any crevice or protected location. They may also spread to nearby rooms or apartments. Because bedbugs live solely on blood, having them in your home is not a sign of dirtiness. You are as likely to find them in immaculate homes and hotel rooms as in filthy ones.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Bedbugs are active mainly at night and usually bite people while they are sleeping. They feed by piercing the skin and withdrawing blood through an elongated beak. The bugs feed from three to 10 minutes to become engorged and then crawl away unnoticed.</p>
        <br/>
        <strong>FOR CONTROL OF BED BUGS</strong>
        <br/>
        <p>Complete spray treatment is carried out in the entire premises including main places like the bed in which you sleep and cubboards, sofas etc.. for keeping them under control. The entire area has to be treated to keep them at bay.</p>
