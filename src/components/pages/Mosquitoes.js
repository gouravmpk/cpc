            <strong>MENACE OF MOSQUITOES</strong>
        <p>
        In recent times mosquitoes are a prime menace in the society. Controlling of mosquitoes is of utmost importance due to the rising number of mosquito borne illnesses. Deforestation and Industrialized farming are two major factors causing an alarming increase in the range of mosquitoes. Escaping from mosquitoes has become a necessity as it is one of the major reasons for throwing many to death bed.

        <br/>
        <strong>DISEASES AND ILLNESS CAUSED DUE TO MOSQUITOE BITES</strong>
        <br/>
        <p>The World Health Organization has stated that global warming is expanding the range of mosquitoes that carry malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever putting millions more humans at risk. Malaria mosquitoes appear in upland areas where they have never been seen earlier. Malaria mosquitoes appear in upland areas where they have never been seen earlier. A child dies of malaria every 12 seconds.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Mosquitoes carry many harmful diseases like West Nile Virus Disease, Malaria and in recent times Dengue Fever. Chikunguniya. Lyme Disease etc. Dengue Fever and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever are the most common mosquito bome viral diseases that affect a wide range of people in the world. The same is caused due to the bite of an infected Aedes Mosquito. It is a life threatening disease as there is no longer vaccine or treatment yet found.</p>
        <br/>
        <strong>MEASURES TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES</strong>
        <p>Common methods to take preventive measures to save ourselves from the menace of the mosquito is to use bed nets, clear stagnant water from our surrounding areas and keep drains clean. Other measures like using special products like mosquito repellent to combat mosquitoes. Each product has varying degrees of effectiveness. However, these common methods do not help us to completely stay safe from the mosquito. they are just small precautionary measures to minimize the chances of attracting mosquitoes</p>
       <br/>
       <p>It is almost impossible to permanently eliminate every mosquito breeding area around the home. The most effective way to control mosquitoes is to eliminate them at their source by use of insecticides that can be applied to the area with a fogging and spraying chemical. A professional process can only help controlling mosquito populations.</p>
       <br/>
       <strong>CONTROL OF MOSQUITOES THROUGH FOGGING AND SPRAY TREATMENT</strong>
       <br/>
       <strong>FOGGING TREATMENT</strong>
       <br/>
       <p>A Fogger is a device used to disperse liquid chemicals over large areas within a very small droplet size. The small droplet size allows the chemical to disperse and penetrate deep foliage killing mosquitoes where they hide. Thermal foggers are cost effective mosquito control devices.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Mosquitoes are more active during late afternoon and for this reason fogging at this time is most effective. Mosquitoes typically don't travel far from their reproductive site and for this reason targeted fogging can be highly effective in mosquito control around your property.</p>
       <br/>
        <p>ADVANTAGES OF FOGGING TREATMENT FOR CONTROL OF MOSQUITOES</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Regular fogging significantly controls mosquitoes.</li>
            <li>Fogging helps in covering large areas and penetrating dense foliage</li>
        </ul>

         </div>
         <ul>
             <li>Regular fogging will create a mosquito free environment.</li>
             <li>The affected area and the surrounding area are treated with smoke with the help of a Fogger Machine.</li>
             <li>Fogging helps in controlling mosquitoes and prevents various health hazards caused due to it.</li>
         </ul>

     <strong>ANOTHER METHOD FOR CONTROL OF MOSQUITOES</strong>
     <br/>
     <p>FLY CATCHER MACHINE: This Machine helps attract the mosquitoes and burn them to death. It comes in two models i) CL-14 which covers an open area of 300 sq. ft. and closed area of 600 sq. ft. ii) J-18 covers open area of 500 sq. ft. and closed area of 1000 sq. ft. The said machines can fit in the wall or ceiling. The machine is very useful for control of mosquitoes in the interiors of the premises. The use of the said machine along with Fogging and Spray Treatment for control of mosquitoes will be an added advantage.</p>
