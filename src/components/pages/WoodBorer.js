            <strong>WOOD BORER</strong>
            <br/>
            <p>Woodborers are extremely hazardous and wood destroying beetles also known as the old house borer. The old house borer is a serious pest in homes. They infest seasoned softwoods, especially pine. They are actually more common in new homes. Wood borers invade and damage wood furniture as well as structural and decorative wood inside of buildings. The beetle larvae feed in and do most of the damage to wood and when they reach the adult stage, they emerge through round exit holes, which they create by chewing through the wood surface. Adults of some species also bore exit holes through plaster, plastic, and even soft metals that might cover the underlying wood.</p>

        Most insecticides for wood-boring beetles are restricted and can be used only by certified pest control operators Since pest ontrol operators have access to a wider range of insecticides and equipment, your best option may be to employ a professional.
