        There's a reason you have snakes on your property/ house. Your property/house is in an area of the country that has snakes (that includes most areas), and your property has features that are attractive to snakes. Most commonly, this means that your property is full of debris that attracts snakes. Snakes like a safe place to live and hunt and hide, and places to crawl in. So vegetation is a big snake attractor. So you can, if you wish. eliminate or trim back heavy vegetation. But more than that, if you have any rocks, sidewalk. plywood, a shed, or anything else that snakes can crawl under and den in, then you've really got some attractive snake habitat. Eliminate all of these areas. Maybe the snake is just passing through your yard. Maybe it's a harmless snake, and even good to have around. Not every snake sighting is cause for alarm or active snake removal.

        <strong>For Control of Snake</strong>
       <p1>For control of snakes granules are sprinkled in the boundary of the entire area where there is existence of snakes. These granule works as a repellant for snakes and they do not come to that area again.</p1>
